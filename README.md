# Working with Weiser

A Handy Handbook on working with me

## What are my career goals?

As a developer, I want to:
* **Grow**: I always want to be learning, and improving, in my craft.
* **Help others grow**: Software, more often than not, is built by teams of people.  I want the people I work with to level up in their skill set so that they feel successful at their craft.
* **Provide value for the org**: I want to help the org push the needle and contribute to exceeding the customer's expectations.

## My answers for [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

* What makes you grumpy?

When I percieve that there is a lack of mutual good will among team
members.  If I can tell that there are team members that resemble
competitors, that are trying to tear each other down,  more than they 
resemble a team trying to succeed, it makes me grumpy.

If I'm not learning or growing in my craft, I can get grumpy.  Part of
what I like about software development is that I can always be learning.
Getting exposure to new paradigms (e.g. a new programming language or a
different type of design I haven't seen before) is refreshing because it
represents an opportunity for growth.

* How will I know when you’re grumpy?

I may be reclusive.  I may withold input in team discussions.  I can
tend to wear my heart on my sleeve so I may come across as pretty frosty
if I'm grumpy.

* How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

Having a conversation privately, asking me if I'm grumpy and then giving
me time to share how I'm feeling is probably the best way.

* How do you like feedback - the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)

In-person, or if I'm remote, over a Google Hangout.

* How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens

As it happens.  If I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing, I want to
know sooner, rather than later.

* How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

Public

* What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

1. Knowing where I stand:  I'm my own worst critic.  I usually grade
   myself on a much harsher curve than is warranted.  Having someone to
tell me where I stand can be quite helpful.
2. Goal setting: Setting goals that are useful to the team, useful to
   the org, and interesting to me can energize me.

* What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

Getting spun up on Elixir.
Getting comfortable on the Pro Backend team.

* What do you need from your manager?

An advocate who will give me encouragement, constructive criticism and
nudge me to do the right thing, even if it is difficult.

* What do you need from your team?

1. We want each other, and the org, to succeed.
2. Assume good intent.
3. When I ask for help, ask me probing questions like:
  * "What have you tried so far?"
  * "What is your understanding of the problem at hand?"

* What do you need from your peers? (outside the team)

Assume good intent.

* What’s your favourite baked good?

If a dessert-type thing, brownies.
If a savory-type thing, croissants.
