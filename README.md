# Working with Weiser

A Handy Handbook on working with me

## What are my career goals?

As a developer, I want to:
* **Grow**: I always want to be learning, and improving, in my craft.
* **Help others grow**: Software, more often than not, is built by teams of people.  I want the people I work with to level up in their skill set so that they feel successful at their craft.
* **Provide value for the org**: I want to help the org push the needle and contribute to exceeding the customer's expectation

## My answers for [first 1:1 questions](http://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

* What makes you grumpy?
* How will I know when you’re grumpy?
* How can I help you when you’re grumpy?
* How do you like feedback - the medium (IRC, email, in person, etc.)
* How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens
* How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)
* What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?
* What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?
* What do you need from your manager?
* What do you need from your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)
* What do you need from your peers? (outside the team)
* Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?
